# Macro 

Macros in Jinja are pieces of code that can be reused multiple times â€“ they are analogous to "functions" in other programming languages, and are extremely useful if you find yourself repeating code across multiple models. 
Macros are defined in .sql files, typically in your macros directory [doc](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/macro-paths)
